To remain competitive in a VUCA world, the Singapore Government has initiated the skillsfuture movement to ensure that the “skills, passion and contributions of every individual will drive Singapore's next phase of development towards an advanced economy and inclusive society”.

With NIE’s wealth of knowledge in evidence-based practices that are contextualised, effective and scalable for adoption in K-12 schools, it can potentially scale up AI and SoL research in education interventions.  The role of research is thus to provide the evidence that guides the practice and, more importantly, to allow the practice to extend into new contexts.</div><div style=""text-align:justify"">We are interested in candidates with expertise in AI literacy, learning through/with AI supported or enabled technologies (e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, educational data mining, and etc) and AI enabled assessments and analytics.</div><div style=""text-align:justify"">Candidates with appropriate qualifications and relevant research experience are encouraged to apply.

To remain competitive in a VUCA world, the Singapore Government has initiated the skillsfuture movement to ensure that the “skills, passion and contributions of every individual will drive Singapore's next phase of development towards an advanced economy and inclusive society”.

Hence, AI and Science of Learning (SoL) should co-inform each other. With NIE’s wealth of knowledge in evidence-based practices that are contextualised, effective and scalable for adoption in K-12 schools, it can potentially scale up AI and SoL research in education interventions.  The role of research is thus to provide the evidence that guides the practice and, more importantly, to allow the practice to extend into new contexts.</div><div style=""text-align:justify"">We are interested in candidates with expertise in AI literacy, learning through/with AI supported or enabled technologies (e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, educational data mining, and etc) and AI enabled assessments and analytics.</div><div style=""text-align:justify"">Candidates with appropriate qualifications and relevant research experience are encouraged to apply.
