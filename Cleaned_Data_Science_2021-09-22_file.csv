Contributing to this is a set of headwinds unique to integrative data analysis in this domain. Phenotypic (trait) and genetic information is often held by different parties. Genetic data often cannot be shared in raw form with third parties. Relevant medical data can be described with a number of different ontologies.One mission of the Emerging Solutions team at Illumina is to build software to address this set of challenges. We identify market need for integrative analysis, and research and implement software to meet these needs. Areas of current activity include creation of tools to combine and distill large population sequencing efforts (trillions of genotype/phenotype data points), and techniques for federated analysis and ML model training in cases where primary genetic data cannot be shared.As a Staff Software Engineer in the Emerging Solutions team, you will become expert in this problem domain, identify emerging, novel computational techniques to address these challenges, and build software to help unlock untapped value in genetic data.
