We think there is value in early intervention. Using mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data, the first goal is to therefore, examine at what point resolution of batch effects provides greatest positive impact (raw data, peptide identification, inferred protein). Secondly, ambiguously mapped peptides are often discarded prior to protein mapping but also carry useful information regarding batch-effect loading, this project examines the cost, in terms of being able to estimate batch effect, of discarding this information source. Thirdly, missing values are common in proteomics data and are usually resolved by imputation prior to batch effect correction, imputation approaches usually ignore the batch covariate, such that batch effects can creep into proteins due to careless imputation.Your primary role is in would be to help examine the extent of this problem. In collaboration with our lab members, you will also help develop solutions.In addition, you will also partake in various machine learning and AI-driven initiatives involving the use of MS data in clinical diagnostics.

Critical to malaria transmission, is the process of sexual commitment resulting in the production of gametocytes.This work aims to identify how environment stresses are sensed by the malaria parasite resulting in changes in sexual commitment.

We think there is value in early intervention. Using mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data, the first goal is to therefore, examine at what point resolution of batch effects provides greatest positive impact (raw data, peptide identification, inferred protein). Secondly, ambiguously mapped peptides are often discarded prior to protein mapping but also carry useful information regarding batch-effect loading, this project examines the cost, in terms of being able to estimate batch effect, of discarding this information source. Thirdly, missing values are common in proteomics data and are usually resolved by imputation prior to batch effect correction, imputation approaches usually ignore the batch covariate, such that batch effects can creep into proteins due to careless imputation.Your primary role is to help examine the extent of this problem. In collaboration with our lab members, you will also help develop solutions.In addition, you will also partake in various machine learning and AI-driven initiatives involving the use of MS data in clinical diagnostics.

The project aims to develop a new generation of mRNA based vaccines. The goal of the computational part of the project is to develop methods for predicting RNA tertiary structures and optimizing RNA stability.
The recent breakthrough of AlphaFold2 in accurately predicting protein structures paves the way for applying deep learning techniques to grand challenges in biology. However, it is critical to emphasize that learning RNA tertiary structures is significantly more challenging than protein structures. Only 15,000 chains in 5,000 RNA structures are present in the PDB, 30-fold less than the 150,000 training proteins. The lack of experimental training data requires us to: (1) augment the training set with new experimental data, (2) design more theoretically expressive learning techniques than AlphaFold2, which rely on a standard supervised learning framework and a classical Transformer-based architecture.
In this role, one will be part of a multi-disciplinary team consisting of computer scientists, biologists, and bioinformaticians. Duties include primarily developing new AI methods for RNA structure predictions.

The project aims to develop the AI method to detect present microbes in a sample (ie. throat-swab, urine, blood) sequenced using nanopore technology. Nanopore sequencers read DNA/RNA fragments while they are passing through a tiny pore. Passage of nucleotides through pore results in a signal which is in a downstream process converted to the sequence of nucleotides.
The project aims to recognize each microbe using a pattern matching approach like those for rapid song recognition using either raw signal or basecalled sequence of nucleotides. We plan to use deep learning methods to find a concise representation of each known microbe genome.
The fast and accurate detection of microbes that cause infections disease can reduce unnecessary usage of antibiotics, speed up recovery and sometimes even save lives. When clinicians do not have a clue about the possible pathogen, the current methods can last days to identify the pathogen correctly.

Curiox manufactures and sells instruments, automation products, and disposables for cell and protein analysis. The major application of Curiox Laminar Wash™ systems is centrifuge-free sample preparation of cells for Flow Cytometry, Single Cell Genomics, and other emerging cell analysis applications. The Laminar Wash instruments of MINI, HT, and AUTO address unmet needs by enabling affordable, off-the-shelf automation of the current, labor-intensive cell analysis process. Furthermore, the products improve the overall data quality such as cell retention, consistency, and reproducibility.Curiox products are used by customers performing life science research, immunology, immunotherapy, drug discovery diagnostics, vaccine research, and cell therapy research and manufacturing.“There’s this thought among scientists that the only way to prepare suspension cells for analysis is to use centrifugation. Curiox has invented a better way to prepare samples. One that’s good for cells is also good for scientists. We believe sample preparation can be affordable, have a good workflow, be less labor-intensive and reproducible. That’s why we’ve created Laminar Wash technology to help scientists prepare samples in a way that treats their cells gently so as not to introduce further variables into important experiments. If you’re ready to help scientists get better results and break them out of their entrenched ways of sample preparation, Curiox is the right place for you.”Namyong Kim, PhD.

Abnormal TNF signaling is a major risk factor for many human ailments ranging from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), metabolic syndrome (MS) to cancers, where inflammation is an underlying cause. Currently, the annual global cost of cancer care alone is upwards of $5 trillion. Cancers and MS are also the leading killers in Singapore. Not surprisingly, targeting TNF itself has been a therapeutic option in some of these disorders like RA. But systemic therapy targeting TNF is very costly, causes general immune suppression, and does not work for many chronic inflammatory conditions besides RA. Given TNFs pivotal role in physiology, “precision” anti-TNF drugs that work selectively, in many ailments besides RA are badly needed. However, unlike with precision oncology, several gaps in our understanding of the TNF pathway have prevented us from developing “precision anti-TNF drugs” which work in cell/context specific manner. This begs the question; have we identified and characterized all the components that regulate TNF signaling? Given that only 2% of the genome codes for proteins, and a large number of RNAs are induced during inflammation, is it possible that we have totally missed looking for RNAs as structural and regulatory components of TNF signaling? Using single cell methods we aim to comprehensively identify, and spatially delineate the cell-type specific roles of RNAs and RBPs, hitherto undiscovered components of TNF signalling, in inflammation, development and cancer. Our studies will identify novel targets that selectively block unwanted effects of systemic anti-TNF therapy in ailments besides RA and help remodel “cold tumors” for effective immune or chemotherapy.RNA driven cell:cell communication in development:Tightly regulated transcription of growth factors upon activation of signalling pathways by internal and external cues is central in cellular differentiation. Although it is known that increased inflammation overturns development, whether inflammatory RNAs are important for cell-cell interactions during embryogenesis is unknown. To resolve this stimulating question, we aim to decipher the spatial and temporal dynamics of inflammatory RNAs in relation to the transcriptional state of cells during mammalian development. We will focus specifically on the endoderm-mesoderm communication as there are parallel independent observations that RNA processing may be required in this cell-cell communication. We will profile the transcriptome of single cells and use computational modelling to infer the mechanisms responsible for the transcription and editing of inflammatory RNAs. We will intersect these data with other data from spatial transcriptomics to draw a spatial-temporal post-transcriptional roadmap underlying early phases of organ formation. We will conclude by merging the function of inflammatory RNAs in a spatial-temporal model of pattern formation in development. This model will complement the already established pathways of transcriptional control of endoderm-mesoderm interaction in embryo development and will enable an improved understanding of the effect of inflammation in this context.Job Requirements:Ph.D in Molecular biology, genetics, cancer biology or related fieldsOne first author publication in a reputed international journal along with enthusiasm and active interest in pursuing research in area of genomics, cancer, inflammation and metabolism.Experience in molecular biology, cancer biology, inflammation and computational genomics (including single-cell genomic and proteomic analysis) and mouse genetics will be a plus.Interested candidates are to email a detailed CV that includes research motivation and publication list by clicking ''Apply Now''.The above eligibility criteria are not exhaustive.

SMART CAMP addresses key technology bottlenecks in cell therapy manufacturing: (i) critical quality attributes of safe, effective cell therapy products; and (ii) integrated process analytics to monitor and modulate those attributes. While cell therapies are poised to transform healthcare for both the industry and the patient, there remain many outstanding scientific and technical challenges to significant global impact that this R&amp;D programme addresses. This high-impact focus includes measurement and feedback control of processing parameters (process analytic technologies, or PAT) that contribute to cell viability and function during cell proliferation, and the measurement at intermediate and final steps of the cell product properties correlated with positive therapeutic outcomes (critical quality attributes, or CQA).This interdisciplinary team comprises engineers, biologists, clinicians, manufacturing, and data analytics experts from multiple MIT academic units, and multiple Singapore-based universities, research centres of excellence, and hospitals who are experienced at translational demonstrations of technologies in safety-regulated industries such as cell therapies. As with all postdoctoral associates (PDAs) in SMART CAMP based in Singapore, the PDA will work in a diverse team of experts including several principal investigators (PIs) and PDAs, and receive direct mentorship regarding career development from a pair of who are based in Singapore and at MIT, respectively.CAMP’s unique, enabling and cross-cutting capabilities include cell and clinical biology, microfluidics, real-time optics and spectroscopies, 3D-printed devices, process analytics, data analytics, and bioinformatics. This programme will demonstrate these approaches required of cell-based personalized medicine through three translational testbeds (three Flagship Projects), ultimately facilitating access for more patients to life-saving, approved cell therapies for currently intractable health challenges. These flagship projects will address allogeneic and autologous cell therapy products, including but not limited to cell sources including adult stem/progenitor cells and immune cells for treatment of specific cancers, tissue degeneration, and autoimmune diseases. This PDA is part of the core postdoctoral research team of CAMP, and will contribute his/her/their expertise to all three flagship projects as appropriate:Flagship Project 1: Label-free critical quality attributes (CQA) for personalized efficacy of cell therapies, including multivariate analysis of biological and biophysical attributesFlagship Project 2: Rapid critical quality attributes (CQA) for safety of cell sources &amp; cell therapy products, including process analytic technologies (PAT)Flagship Project 3: Integrated process analytic technologies (PAT) for cell proliferation and recovery, including in-line and intermittent monitoring to promote efficacy and safety CQAJob ResponsibilitiesCAMP Core – Mesenchymal stromal/progenitor cell biology/process development specialist/clinical applicationsSMART CAMP research will focus on multiple cell types and targeted indications, to address critical bottlenecks in cell therapy production. As CAMP will include an initial focus on cell/indication pairs such as mesenchymal stem or stromal/progenitor cells for paracrine signaling or for tissue regeneration, deep expertise is essential in adult stem cell (tissue cell progenitor or blood cell progenitor) and mesenchymal stromal cell biology at the basic and translational levels to support development of both the cells’ critical quality attributes (CQA) and culture systems’ process analytic technologies (PAT). This PDA will contribute expertise in stem cell and mesenchymal stromal cell biology, process development, and clinical applications, to:Establish the best practices for stem or stromal cell manufacturing and culturing, particularly for adherent stem and stromal cell subpopulationsDetermine how biological traits and biophysical characteristics for a desired application/functional phenotype interrelate for positive therapeutic outcomeDetermine whether and how those CQA vary if cells are genetically manipulated rather than minimally processed.Lead and coordinate stem and stromal cell production and characterization to facilitate a wide array of projects within CAMP, including identifying novel attributes for cell efficacy, safety, and manufacturability toward good lab or manufacturing practice (GLP or GMP) conditions.Quantify key sources of variation among donors, culture conditions, and process development choices for a given set of targeted in vivo outcomes, and in vivo preclinical experimentsInterface with a diverse array of CAMP teammates and the larger Singapore cell manufacturing community, ranging from engineers to clinicians to GMP manufacturers and regulatory scientists.Job RequirementsPh.D. in Cell Biology, Cell Process Engineering, or a closely related fieldExperience with primary human stem cell isolation and culture, flow cytometry/FACS, and other means of biological cell characterization (microscopy, ELISA, microfluidics, etc.)Experience with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and/or bioinformatics is an assetExperience with preclinical in vivo experiment design and execution for analysis of clinical endpoints is an assetExposure to GMP and industrial processing of MSCs or stem cells is preferred but not requiredAble to work well and communicate ideas effectively in a multidisciplinary team of researchers with different training backgroundsGood track record of publications and scientific outputSelf-motivated, independent, with superior organizational and analytical skillsInterested applicants are invited to send in their full CV/resume, cover letter and list of three references (to include reference names and contact information).
